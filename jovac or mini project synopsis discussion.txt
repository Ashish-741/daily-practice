Speech-to-Text Note Maker using Machine Learning and Web Technologies
Problem Statement
In today’s fast-paced academic and professional environments, note-taking is a critical skill, but manual transcription is often time-consuming and inefficient. 
Students, researchers, and professionals struggle to keep up with lectures, meetings, or discussions while ensuring accuracy and completeness in their notes. 
Moreover, searching through lengthy notes without summaries, keywords, or categorized topics further reduces productivity.

Objective and Scope

Objectives:

Convert audio into accurate text using an ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) model.

Summarize long transcripts into concise, easy-to-read bullet points.

Automatically extract key terms and important keywords.

Classify notes into predefined categories like Education, Technology, Health, etc.

Provide a user-friendly interface where transcripts, summaries, keywords, and topics can be viewed, saved, or downloaded.

Scope:

Applicable for students (lecture transcription), researchers, journalists, and corporate employees (meeting notes).

Scalable to cloud-based systems with user accounts for personalized note storage.

Enhancements like multilingual support, search functionality, and real-time summarization can be integrated in the future.


Methodology

Speech-to-Text Conversion

Use pre-trained ML models like Whisper/Vosk for accurate transcription of lectures/meetings.

Text Processing (ML Models):

Keyword Extraction: Train a lightweight ML model to identify important terms.

Topic Classification: Train a supervised model (SVM/Naive Bayes) to categorize notes into topics.

Summarization: Use pre-trained NLP models (e.g., HuggingFace Transformers) for concise summaries.

Bullet Points Generator: Convert extracted key sentences into easy-to-read bullet points.

Web Application Development

Frontend: React/HTML/CSS/JS for user interaction.

Backend: Flask/Django (Python) or Node.js with REST APIs.

Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB for storing transcripts, notes, and metadata.

Hardware & Software Requirements

Hardware:

Processor: Intel i5 or higher.

RAM: 8GB minimum.

Storage: 500GB HDD / 256GB SSD.

Software:

Programming Languages: Python, JavaScript.

Frameworks: Flask/FastAPI (Backend), React.js (Frontend).

NLP/ML Libraries: Hugging Face Transformers, spaCy, NLTK, scikit-learn.

Database: MySQL / MongoDB.

Tools: GitHub, VS Code, PyCharm.

Future Work

Real-time live transcription.

Cloud storage & user accounts.

Multilingual support.

Integration with productivity tools like Google Docs or MS OneNote.

Enhanced accuracy with fine-tuned models for specific domains (e.g., medical, legal).


Limitations of the Proposed System

Dependency on Model Accuracy: Speech-to-text and summarization quality depend heavily on the chosen models and datasets. Accents, background noise, and poor audio quality may reduce accuracy.

Resource Intensive: Running advanced NLP models (e.g., BERT, Pegasus) may require GPU support for faster inference, making it less efficient on low-end hardware.

Scalability Challenges: While the system can work locally, scaling it for multiple concurrent users may require cloud infrastructure and optimization.

Language Limitations: Initial version may primarily support English; extending to multilingual support requires additional datasets and fine-tuning.

Storage & Privacy Concerns: Storing transcripts and audio data in a database or cloud may raise privacy/security concerns for sensitive information.

Internet Dependence (for APIs): If third-party APIs like Google Speech-to-Text are used, the system cannot function offline and will incur usage costs.

Conclusion

Lexora aims to provide a smart, AI-powered note-taking assistant that makes lectures, meetings, and research discussions more efficient. 
By combining speech-to-text, summarization, keyword extraction, and topic classification in a single system, it helps users save time, stay organized, and focus on understanding rather than just writing. 
The project stands out by integrating multiple NLP techniques into a single user-friendly web application.
